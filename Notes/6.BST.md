# Deleting a node with 2 children in BST(Lecture 16)

Given a tree like this:

How to delete the root node **k** which has 2 children? Seems simply move **e** or **v** won't work. In this case, we need to find the:

- Biggest node that's smaller than the **left children of k**, i.e., **g**.
- Or the Smallest node that's bigger than the **right children of k**, i.e., **m**.

Then we move the node we pick to the original root, this guarantees that everything on its left is smaller than it, and everything on it's right is larger than it.

And the node we pick **must have no child or only one child**, so the deletion of this node will be simple.
