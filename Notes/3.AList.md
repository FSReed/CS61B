## Another problem of Linked Lists

Consider when we are trying to get an element from a linked list, e.g. a list with 1,000,000 elements, and we are trying to take the 500,000th element from it. In an array it's easy to access this element by specifying the position of this element, like `a[500000]`, but in linked list, we need to search for this position from the start of the list. That would be annoying.

## Naive AList

Just use an array as a list, and a size variant to cache the size of the list. Every time we add an element into the list, it would be added at `array[size]`

## Resizeing Arrays

Notice that the naive Alist's maximum size is set when this AList is created, and can't grow larger anymore.

## Ways to resize

- 1. We can create a new array whose capacity is just one more larger than the original list every time we try to add an element to the current list when the list is already full. This is super slow when the list becomes very large.
- 2. We can then add more space every time, or just multiply the capacity of the current list. This works, but when the list is giant, copy all the elements from one array to another is painful. In other words, it's inefficient in space.
- 3. The trade-offs: we can define a usage-ratio, like the list's `R = size / length`, when R is smaller than e.g. 0.25, we cut off half of the list.
