# General Introduction

This is the second course I take in CS series(first is CS61A). Compared to CS61A, I've been more familiar with some daily used tools like Git and Markdown etc. When I wrote this down, **I've just finished Lab3**, and I can feel that this course teaches not only Data Structures, but also cultivate skills in real world projects, like how to debug efficiently. I believe it will help a lot in my future studies.  
And what's more, I found myself really lucky to be able to use Gradescope for scoring my labs and projects, because 1 year later it would be closed. Huge thanks to CS61B staff, especially Professor Josh Hug!
